# ClusteringMallCustomers

This project explores various clustering algorithms applied to the Mall Customers dataset to identify meaningful customer segments. We implement and compare KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model, and DBSCAN using Silhouette Score metric. The goal is to evaluate each methodâ€™s effectiveness and gain insights into the underlying data structure through visualizations and quantitative analysis.
